# Week 4: Vector Intro, Geopandas, CRS, Projections

UW Geospatial Data Analysis  
CEE498/CEWA599  
David Shean  

This week, please finish your Week 3 Numpy/Pandas/Matplotlib notebook lab exercises, then follow the instructions on the github repo README to push to Github (make sure to switch to `%matplotlib inline`!), then “submit” the url for your repo on the Canvas assignment page.

## Overview
During class on Friday, we are going to cover some basic geospatial data concepts, including coordinate systems, projections/transformations, vector geometries (point/line/polygon) and basic geometry operations (intersect, buffer, etc). We will also explore the GeoPandas package (https://geopandas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for further analysis of the ICESat point dataset.

>“GeoPandas is an open source project to make working with geospatial data in python easier. GeoPandas extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types. Geometric operations are performed by shapely. Geopandas further depends on fiona for file access and descartes and matplotlib for plotting.”

## Reading and Tutorials
Please take some time (~0.5-1 hour) before lab on Friday to review some of the following material (especially if you have limited GIS experience), and come with questions on topics that are unclear, so we can discuss together.  There is some overlap in content, but they offer different presentations of the essential material, so hopefully one or more will work for you:

* https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/03-crs/index.html (just this page, no need to do others in the sequence)
* https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/02-intro-vector-data/index.html (just this page, no need to do others in the sequence)
* The first 4 sections (let’s hold off on Advanced Topics) of the Vector Geohackweek tutorial: https://geohackweek.github.io/vector/
* If you learn better with an instructor explaining, video of Emilio Mayorga is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3PMTnhl1eY&feature=youtu.be
