# GDA Course Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, 
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, 
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, 
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, 
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be 
reported directly to the GDA course instructor (dshean@uw.edu or a direct message to @dshean on Slack). 
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and with respect 
to the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Additionally, through numerous policies, UW provides more formal channels 
for addressing violence, harassment, discrimination, and bias. Bias and 
violations of UW policy for nondiscrimination can be reported anonymously
[here][bias reporting]. Sex and gender based violence and harassment is addressed here:

> UW, through [numerous policies][title ix], prohibits sex- and gender-based violence 
> and harassment, and we expect students, faculty, and staff to act professionally
> and respectfully in all work, learning, and research environments. 
>
> For support, resources, and reporting options related to sex- and gender-based
> violence or harassment, visit [UW Title IX’s webpage][uw title ix page], specifically the [Know Your 
> Rights & Resources guide][title ix kyr]. 
> 
> Please know that if you choose to disclose information to the GDA course instructor about sex- or 
> gender-based violence or harassment, they will connect you (or the person who 
> experienced the conduct) with resources and individuals who can best provide 
> support and options. You can also access those resources directly:
> - Confidential: [Confidential advocates][confidential advocates] will not share information with others 
> unless given express permission by the person who has experienced the harm or 
> when required by law.
> - Private and/or anonymous: [SafeCampus][safecampus] provides consultation and support and 
> can connect you with additional resources if you want them. You can contact 
> SafeCampus anonymously or share limited information when you call.
>
> Please note that some senior leaders and other specified employees have been 
> identified as “[Officials Required to Report.”][officials req to report] If an Official Required to Report 
> learns of possible sex- or gender-based violence or harassment, they are required
> to call SafeCampus and report all the details they have in order to ensure that 
> the person who experienced harm is offered support and reporting options.
