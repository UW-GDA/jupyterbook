# Week 1: Shell and Github

UW Geospatial Data Analysis  
CEE498/CEWA599  
David Shean  

Please quickly read through this entire document once, then go back and start tackling the various tasks.

## Overview
I am going to “flip the classroom” for the first two weeks. Before class, you will be responsible for reviewing material from external resources. Consider this your homework. During our Friday meetings, I will briefly review some of this material and do an interactive demo, we will discuss questions and clarify concepts as a class, and then collaboratively work on some problems/exercises to help solidify the concepts (which will inevitably lead to more questions and discussion). I think this is the best use of our limited time together.

## Week 1 Logistics
Please take 5-10 minutes to review the syllabus before our first lab on Friday. I’ve enabled comments on the Google Doc, so if you find any mistakes or have questions, please add comments inline, and/or come to class ready to ask questions.

Bring a laptop to class on Friday. If this is an issue, please email me (dshean@uw.edu), and we can figure out a solution.

Please complete all of the items outlined in the [Student Initial Setup](../../resources/students/student_initial_setup.md) document.

## Reading and Tutorials
I recommend that you break these lessons up into a few sessions, so you have some time to digest what you’re learning (don’t attempt to get through everything an hour before class on Friday). Even if you are already an expert on these topics, please take some time to work through the lessons. I guarantee that you will learn something new or will gain a better understanding of something that you’ve seen before (I certainly did). 

In preparation for the first class, please work your way through the following lessons:

### 1. Unix shell
* Software Carpentry: http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/ (~2-4 hours). 
* You don’t need to master all of this material, but you need to know the basics (navigating the filesystem, previewing/editing text files, basic for loops and conditionals). Please try to read through most of the lessons and do some interactive exploration on your own.
* If you already feel very comfortable with the shell, and the beginner material is too basic, spend some time working through the intermediate lesson: http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-extras/.  

### 2. Git and Github
* You will need to be comfortable with basic git functionality (`clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`), and will need more advanced functionality later in the quarter. 
* If you’ve never worked with git and github, it’s going to be confusing at first. Please do your best to understand the basics. Review and work through these introductory guides (or search the web for other introductory material):
    * https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/
    * https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-git-and-github-6fcd0f2d4ac6
* If those were easy/fast, review the table of contents for the Software Carpentry lessons, and decide for yourself which components will be most valuable based on your experience:
    * http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/ (~2-3 hours)
    * Make sure you attempt the relevant exercises!

If all of this is new, don’t sweat it, but you will need to put in the extra time during the first three weeks of class to practice and get up to speed. This means actually typing the commands from the tutorial on your computer and reviewing the output (don’t just skim or selectively copy/paste). 

If you’re stuck or confused, please send a message to the #lab01_shell_git Slack channel, and I (or others in the class) can help you work through issues.

## Assignment: Due Friday
* Send me a direct Slack message with your github username (do this as soon as possible)
* Complete the above reading
* Fill out this form: https://forms.gle/6vYwr3UfFRrumGcV9

## Outlook
During week 2, we will review Python, iPython/Juptyer, and continue exploring the shell and git/github. There will be opportunities to continue learning all of this material throughout the course, but I want to reiterate that this is not an intro Python or intro programming class. By week 3, I’m hoping that everyone will be comfortable with the basics, and we can jump into some actual geospatial applications. With that said, I’ve intentionally kept the schedule flexible, so we can adjust as we go along - I need to calibrate after I get a better sense of everyone’s experience level.
