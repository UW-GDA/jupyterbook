# Week 6: Vector 2, Geometries, Spatial Operations, Visualization

UW Geospatial Data Analysis  
CEE498/CEWA599  
David Shean  

During class on Friday, we are going to revisit vectors, geometry operations, spatial/attribute joins, and visualization.  We will illustrate some of these concepts with the GLAS point dataset and the U.S. State outlines.

## Reading and Tutorials
Please take some time (~1 hour) before lab on Friday to review the following material (especially if you have limited GIS experience), and come with questions on topics that are unclear, so we can discuss together.  There is some overlap in content, but different presentation of the essential material, so hopefully one or more will work for you:

### Vector basics
* Lessons 2, 3, 4, 5 from https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/site/index.html
* https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2017/lessons/L3/overview.html

### Geopandas and Shapely
* https://geopandas.org/geometric_manipulations.html
