# Week 5: Raster Intro, GDAL, rasterio, Landsat-8

UW Geospatial Data Analysis

This week, please finish your Week 4 Vector1 notebook lab exercise.  Remember to rerun your noteboook with to `%matplotlib inline`, push to your repo, then “submit” the url for your repo on the Canvas assignment page.

## Overview
During class on Friday, we are going to cover raster basics.  We will introduce and use `gdal` and `rasterio` to process, analyze and visualize sample Landsat-8 satellite imagery.

## Reading and Tutorials
Please take some time (~1 hour) before lab on Friday to review the following material (especially if you have limited GIS experience), and come with questions on topics that are unclear, so we can discuss together.  There is some overlap in content, but different presentation of the essential material, so hopefully one or more will work for you:
