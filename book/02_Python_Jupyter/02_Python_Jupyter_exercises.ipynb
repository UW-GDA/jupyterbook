    "- Last week we did some basic manipulation of the `words` text file using `bash` shell.  \n",
    "- Let's repeat some of this analysis using Python.  \n",
    "- For each question or task below, write some code in the empty cell and execute to preserve your output \n",
    "- Work together, consult resources we've discussed (e.g., Whirlwind Tour of Python, Python documentation, Stack Overflow), post to `#lab02_python_jupyter` Slack channel\n",
    "- Save the completed notebook, and use the basic `git add; git commit; git push` workflow to upload by next Friday\n",
    "- Submit the url pointing to your Github assignment repo on Canvas assignment\n",
